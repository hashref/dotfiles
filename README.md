# dotfiles

A collection of my dotfiles to make personalizing a new system much easier. Pretty basic stuff.

## Initialize

This project uses git submodules to install vim plugins and such. Therefore, in order to have all this function, you need to run the following commands after you clone this repo.

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
